# Stanley-Terrain-Classification

Stanley is a self driving car robot, which is trained to adjust the speed of car using supervised learning 
in different terrains. It will do that on the baises of two features used in this data set, steepness and ruggesness.
The steepness of the terrain, weather it's a flat or it's a hill, and then there's the ruggedness of the terrain. 
How much the vehicle bops up and down which we can, we can actually measure inside a car.

The goal here is to train stanley to whether to go slow or fast in the given terrain, using supervised learning algorithim.
